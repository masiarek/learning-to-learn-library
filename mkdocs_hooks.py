"""Build-time fixes that would otherwise cost a pinned plugin dependency.

Three jobs, all about finding your way around:

1. **Clean chapter labels.** MkDocs derives a section label from the folder name
   on disk, so `01_Precision/` reads as "01 Precision". The numeric prefix exists
   to set reading order in a file listing; it should not be visible in the nav.
   Only *prefixed* folders are relabelled — a lesson folder takes its label from
   its page's own H1, which is already written the way it should read.

2. **Order the sections.** `NAV_ORDER` states the intended reading order per
   folder, keyed by folder path, listing children by their on-disk name. At the
   top level the chapters are the exception: they sort by name, A to Z, wherever
   the `CHAPTERS` marker sits, because the owner looks a subject up by name. The
   numbers still give the suggested reading order, which Start Here spells out.
   Inside a chapter the lessons keep their reading order, because each chapter
   is one argument and its steps depend on the ones before.

3. **Keep the topic map complete.** `TOPICS.md` groups every lesson by subject.
   A lesson missing from it is logged as a warning, and `mkdocs build --strict`
   (what CI runs) fails on a warning, so a new lesson cannot ship without a
   place on the map.

Why order here rather than by renaming files: a filename is a permanent URL.
Renumbering `03_` to `04_` to insert a lesson would move every page after it and
break any link anyone saved. Ordering is presentation, so it belongs in the
presentation layer. Unlisted pages keep their alphabetical slot at the bottom, so
adding a page needs no edit here.

One structural note that is easy to get wrong: the top-level object MkDocs hands
`on_nav` is a `Navigation`, whose children live on `.items`. Only `Section` has
`.children`. A hook that reaches for `.children` at the top level silently does
nothing at all — the build still succeeds, and the sidebar is simply never
touched.
